Welcome
-------

The 0MQ lightweight messaging kernel is a library which extends the
standard socket interfaces with features traditionally provided by
specialised messaging middleware products. 0MQ sockets provide an
abstraction of asynchronous message queues, multiple messaging patterns,
message filtering (subscriptions), seamless access to multiple transport
protocols and more.

Atomic zeromq modifies some of the messaging guarantees that zeromq makes
to allow differentiated publisher policies.
The modified library allows one to set messaging policy on sockets such
as best effort/ all or none and so on.


Building and installation
-------------------------

See the INSTALL file included with the distribution.


Resources
---------

Extensive documentation is provided with the distribution. Refer to
doc/zmq.html, or "man zmq" after you have installed 0MQ on your system.

This is a modified version of zeromq which uses an atomic variation of publish subscribe.
This means that the messages will not be silently dropped instead zeromq will accept a sendmsg
only when the message can be delivered to all eligible recipients.

0MQ developers can also be found on the IRC channel #zeromq, on the
Freenode network (irc.freenode.net).
